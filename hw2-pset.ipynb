    "\n",
    "The United States president is chosen every four years via a _presidential election_. Most US citizens can participate in presidential elections by _voting_ in one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia. Exceptions include citizens under 18 years of age, citizens convicted of certain crimes, citizens not registered to vote, and citizens residing in [US territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most US politicians, as well as many US voters, belong to one of two _political parties_: the [Democratic Party](https://democrats.org/) and the [Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/). The current president, Donald Trump, belongs to the Republican Party, while the previous president, Joe Biden, belongs to the Democratic Party. Presidential candidates may also represent smaller parties (like the [Libertarian Party](https://lp.org/) or the [Green Party](https://www.gp.org/)) or run without a party affiliation, but such candidates are usually unsuccessful. The most recent president who belonged to neither the Democratic nor the Republican Party was [Millard Fillmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millard_Fillmore) from the [Whig Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)), who served from 1850 to 1853.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before each presidential election, each party wishing to participate in the election holds a _nominating convention_ where the official candidate for that party is chosen. The nominating conventions for the most recent presidential election (2024) are shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   |   | Location | Dates | Presidential Nominee | \n",

    "### Problem 0b: Understand US Presidential Speeches (No Submission, 0 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will be studying two kinds of speeches:\n",
    "- _nomination acceptance speeches_ given at a party convention, where a new presidential candidate explains why they should be president\n",
    "- _inaugural addresses_ given at an inauguration ceremony, where a new president explains their goals for the next four years.\n",
